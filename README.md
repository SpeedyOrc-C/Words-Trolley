# Words Trolley

A flashcard app that just works.

## Supported Word Language

Unlike other apps, you can add language-specific information to each word:

### French

You can add gender for nouns.

### German

You can add gender for nouns.

### Mandarin

You can add pronunciation for each word.
Supports both Pinyin and Bopomofo (Zhuyin).
You only type one of them, and get the other one automatically.

### Egyptian

We have a dedicated system for typing Hieroglyphs without referring to any Gardiner's signs.

The sound based IME supports transliteration schemes from:

- Manuel de Codage
- Gardiner
- Me?
